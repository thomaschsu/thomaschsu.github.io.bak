               <h1>About Me</h1>
               <img id="profile" src="profile/Profile.jpg" alt="Tom Hsu">
               <p>Tom graduated from Rutgers University in 2012 with a major in Information Technology. After graduation, he worked at a company called MRA International for 5 years.
                  Starting in sales, he quickly moved into the role of an IT Technician. This involved repairing computers as well as imaging them for many school districts.
                  Eventually his role switched over to Website Administration, and worked on the company's website and ecommerce store front.
                  He worked in both Magento 1 and 2, as well as WordPress.

                  On his free time, he likes to drink booze, play video games, watch movies, and work out (in that order). He is knowledgeable in headphones and spends a lot of money on them. He currently owns two high end headphones: Fostex TH900 and Focal Elear, but wasted a lot of money on others in the past (all sold already).
                  He regularly uses the RHA T20 IEM's. His AMP and DAC are the following: Burson Soloist / Schiit BiFrost Multibit. He likes to listen to EDM, Hip-Hop, Rap, Pop, Rock. Tom also enjoys reading about car news and drives a Genesis Coupe.
